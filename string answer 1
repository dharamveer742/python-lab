Ans1 = A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of 
 variable. Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing 
 characters in quotes. Python use single quotes and double quotes to create the string. Creating strings is 
 as simple as assigning a value to a variable. For example âˆ’
 St1 = 'Hello World'
 St2 = "Python Programming"
